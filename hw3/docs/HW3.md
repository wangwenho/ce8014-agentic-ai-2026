# Assignment 3: Autonomous Multi-Doc Financial Analyst

**Due Date:** 3/26 - 4/9  

---

## Objective

- The primary objective of this assignment is to transition from building linear chains to **LangGraph**. Students will learn to construct a state-aware RAG system capable of **Self-Correction** and **Intelligent Routing**.  
- Try to use different embedding models and know the difference.

---

## Task Description

### Task A: LangChain

- **Goal:** construct a text prompt that forces the LLM to follow the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) loop until it finds the answer.  
- **Requirement:** You need to assign a string to the template variable. Your prompt must strictly satisfy the following three categories of requirements:

1. **Technical Requirements (Mandatory Variables):** The LangChain `create_react_agent` function requires specific placeholders to function. If any of these are missing, your code will crash.
    - `{tools}`: The system will inject the list of available tool descriptions here.
    - `{tool_names}`: The system will inject the names of valid tools (e.g., [search_apple_financials]).
    - `{input}`: The user's original question.
    - `{agent_scratchpad}`: Crucial. This is where the agent's "memory" (previous thoughts, actions, and observations) is stored.
2. **Structural Requirements (The ReAct Loop):** You must explicitly instruct the LLM to use the following format:
    - Question: The input question.
    - Thought: The agent should reason about what to do next.
    - Action: The tool to use (must be one of {tool_names}).
    - Action Input: The specific query to send to the tool.
    - Observation: The result returned by the tool (this is provided by the system, but you must list it as a step).
    - Final Answer: The conclusion.
3. **Behavioral Constraints (Quality Control):** To pass the benchmark tests (especially the comparison and detail tasks), your prompt must enforce:
    - **English Only:** The Final Answer must be in English, even if the user asks in Chinese.
    - **Year Precision:** Explicitly warn the agent to distinguish between 2024, 2023, and 2022 columns in financial tables.
    - **Honesty:** If the exact 2024 figure is not found, instructed the agent to say "I don't know" rather than guessing.

### Task B: LangGraph - Intelligent Router

- **Goal:** Replace the hardcoded dummy logic. You must design a prompt that asks the LLM to classify the user's question into one of four categories: `["apple", "tesla", "both", "none"]`.  
- **Requirement:** The agent should dynamically choose which vector store retriever to invoke based on the entity mentioned in the query.

### Task C: LangGraph - Relevance Grader

- **Goal:** Implement a "Binary Judge." The LLM must evaluate the retrieved documents against the user's question.  
- **Requirement:**
  - If the document is relevant -> Output **yes** (Proceed to Generate).  
  - If the document is irrelevant (noise) -> Output **no** (Trigger Rewrite).

### Task D: LangGraph - Query Rewriter

- **Goal:** If the Grader returns no, the agent must not give up. It should rewrite the original question to be more specific or use better financial terminology.  
- **Requirement:** Transform vague queries (e.g., "how much did they spend on new tech") into precise terms (e.g., "Research and Development expenses").

### Task E: LangGraph - Final Generator

- **Goal:** Synthesize the final answer using the retrieved context.  
- **Requirement:**
  - Strictly cite sources (e.g., [Source: Apple 10-K]).  
  - If the information is missing (even after retries), honestly state "I don't know" instead of hallucinating.

## Submission Details

- **Deadline:** 2026/4/9  
- **Late Policy:** Standard course policy applies.

## Benchmark Tasks (For Report)

- Does it detail the differing results caused by using different embedding models? (compare at least 2) (20 points)  
- Detailed comparison between LangGraph and LangChain. (30 points)  
- We used `chunk_size=2000`. If you add it or reduce it, how does it affect the ability to answer questions about large tables (like the Balance Sheet)? Explain the trade-off between "Context Precision" (small chunks) and "Context Completeness" (large chunks). (20 points)
